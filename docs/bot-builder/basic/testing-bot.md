## How to Test Your Bot
========================
Test your bot as you build it to ensure your end users won't experience any annoying bot breakages! You can test your bot in three ways:

- The easiest way to test your bot is to test it directly in the Conversation Studio tool. You can do this by clicking on the "Test Bot" button at the bottom of the left-side menu where you add sub-stories and nodes.

- Another way to test your bot is click the *More* menu on the top bar, within the Conversation Studio and then select *View Credentials*. Now, you get a pop-up with the *Demo Link* to test the bot.

- The third way to test your bot is to deploy and connect the bot to any of the Client SDKs - iOS, Android, Web, Facebook.

## Debugging your Bot
======================

On the Bot-Builder tool, you will see a **Log** icon near the messages you sent once the bot has processed the particular message. Clicking on this icon will provide you details on how the bot is behaving, what nodes were detected, what entities were collected and their value etc.

This information is useful to understand why a bot is behaving in a certain way and how to fix the bot to get the desired results. You can read more about it [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/advanced/debugging-guidelines).

## ORACLE Feedback
===================

The ORACLE Module helps Bot Builders discover methods by which an IVA can be improved and brought to a state where it is utilising capabilities of the ML Model to its maximum potential. It aims to give feedback to Bot Builders on how well the IVA has been trained from the "User Says" and "Nodes" created by the Bot Builder. You can read more about it [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/oracle-feedback).

Welcome to Conversation Design. Before you begin building your Intelligent Virtual Assistant, it is essential to create a framework with conversational journeys first. 

Conversation Design is the art of crafting an experience between a virtual assistant and the end user. The end objective is to craft and create conversations that are natural and intuitive while scaling these conversations across platforms for all users. 

ðŸ’¡ The more clarity you have at the start, the better you can design the bot. 

# How to get started

Step 1: Understand your business objective

Step 2: Select an appropriate design tool such as Lucidchart or draw.io, to build your flows to solve use cases while creating conversations

Step 3: And finally, review using various guidelines and go-live

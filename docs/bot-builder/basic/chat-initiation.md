title: Chat Initiation
---

Words make up a conversation.

And along with words, you also have access to a set of UI elements to make your conversation more engaging. This section aims to give you a complete set of practices and tips that‚Äôll help you craft the conversation! 

Bot replies should be crafted keeping all possible input ways in mind. Content should feel all-natural and not disjointed. This section lists the various ways a conversation can be initiated with a bot and the most effective way to design chat initiation. 

## Menu

a. The menu (sometimes called a taskbox) is the list of items shown to the user when they begin the conversation. It‚Äôs a guide to help them understand what the bot can do for them and is a great point to start designing your user journey as well.

b. The menu is the safest way to start - List all the tasks (isolated items that the bot can do for the user). Examples: Fetching a Bill, Emailing an account statement, Reporting an issue

c. Don't get confused between a usecase and a menu item - Usecase is a bigger umbrella than a menu item (The smallest unit of a usecase is a task).

d. Create categories for the menu. We recommend that only 3-4 are shown on the UI and then View More.

## Freeform

a. List straightforward variations which will lead to that particular task. 
Example: I have a complaint should lead to - Have a complaint task.

b. List other variations which could lead to that particular task. 
Example: My package is late should also lead to - Have a complaint task. This should be handled in a separate node. 

c. We can follow the User Says Guidelines for having a clear picture of writing these variations.

d. One way to guide users who prefer typing in freeform would be the AutoComplete feature on the Haptik platform. You can customize the option that appears within the AutoComplete window by flagging it in the bot builder. [Here‚Äôs](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/user-says#autocomplete-suggestions) the documentation to help you enable it on your IVA.

## Bot Prompts

Bot prompts are ‚Äònotifications‚Äô sent to users to draw their attention to the bot‚Äôs location and help them understand what the bot can do for them. This is explained in detail below. 

- Make sure the button of the prompt leads to the desired node organically. 
**Example**: If your bot prompt CTA says ‚ÄúFind a plan‚Äù, don't immediately ask the user to enter their details in the next message. Ease the user into the conversation by presenting the plan options and then asking for their details. These small touches will result in conversions.

- Don't have misleading content on the prompt. Avoid using it as advertising real estate for your brand. Make sure the bot‚Äôs intentions are clarified at the face value of the prompt.

- You can customize several aspects of prompts including the pages they appear on, the delay after which they appear, how they work for repeat users, and so on. Read more about it in our documentation [here](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/bot-prompt-trigger).

- At the very least, we recommend adding the following bot prompts:

1. **Introductory prompts**: Mostly set on the homepage of the website or app, these prompts are a friendly way to draw attention to the bot.
Example: 
Page: On the Home Page
Prompt: Hi! I'm Zuri, the Zurich virtual assistant. ü§ñ 
May I help you?

2. **Usecase specific prompts**: These prompts can be set on any page where it makes sense to push a particular usecase. 
Example: 
Page: On the sales page for Trading accounts
Prompt: Opening a trading account is as easy as 1, 2, 3...Stuck somewhere? I can help you.
Example: 
Page: On the Technology and Resources Page: These will lead to the Get a chatbot flow
Prompt: ü§î Wondering how our technology can help you? Come, talk to me!

- Some writing tips to keep your prompts interesting:

1. Directly address the customer and use ‚Äúyou‚Äù to draw their attention.
2. Provide a benefit or two.
3. Make it relatable and use the user persona as a guide! Call out the emotional value and problem the user may be facing.

## Launch Message

You can use this when you want your users to be greeted with a welcome message by the bot. This also helps to initiate users gently into a conversation.

## SmallTalk

SmallTalk is a way to ensure that your bot is able to answer chit chat queries. Since chit chat is usually a conversation starter, it is important to consider SmallTalk while designing your Chat Initiation experience.

- The Haptik platform has a plug-and-play SmallTalk module that allows you to completely edit all SmallTalk nodes (around 99 separate intents) and choose your own persona, brand, and content.

- While you‚Äôre editing the SmallTalk module, make sure that you include a menu list as a response for intents like Greetings, Start_Chat, and Capability. This is important because users want to know what the bot can do for them even though they are chitchatting. If you have the time, we recommend adding some form of re-engagement option to every single intent. 

- [Here‚Äôs](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/smalltalk) the link to the official documentation that covers everything you need to know.

## Generic Tips

1. Clearly introduce your bot.

2. Start with a smile. Not all bots need to be super chatty, hilarious, or whacky but setting a friendly, trustworthy tone at the beginning is important. It tells the user that the bot is meant to solve their issues and not be an annoying machine to prevent human contact.

3. Set clear expectations. This will dictate the success of your bot. Tell the user what the bot can do and give them an option if they can‚Äôt find their query on the supported list. Ask them to satate their query in keywords if that‚Äôs what your bot understands best.

4. Don‚Äôt be bot centric. Focus on the user instead of focusing on the bot. 
Example: When the bot is unable to understand a user‚Äôs query, instead of saying, ‚ÄúOops! I didn‚Äôt understand that because I‚Äôm a bot‚Äù, say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that your query wasn‚Äôt resolved. Would you like to start over?‚Äù.

üí° Tip: Take cues from a real human assistant and read your content out loud to gauge whether it comes across as empathetic and natural.

## Understanding Chat Initiation on WhatsApp

A WhatsApp Bot is fairly different from most other kinds of chatbots you might be familiar with. Typically, UI elements such as buttons and quick replies are a key aspect in streamlining a chatbot experience. UI elements not only help to propel the conversation forward but also help the user to achieve their end goal in the quickest way possible.

## WhatsApp Bot Building Design Hacks

WhatsApp as a reach platform is exponential but it comes with its own limitations. This is where you can let your creativity kick in, let‚Äôs do a comparison of UI elements on a bot vs on WhatsApp and some creative workarounds for limitations.

### Carousel vs Image

In a web bot a carousel is used to display multiple options the user can pick from, it also has supported copy and buttons and looks like this üëá

Just like a carousel has an image and copy that goes along with it, on WhatsApp you can use images along with captions giving the user clear instructions of what he/she has to type to move forward, here is an example below üëá

### Bot Breaks

Bot breaks on web bots are often supported with buttons/quick replies to propel the user to move forward.

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

Since the facility of buttons/quick replies is not available on WhatsApp we have to ask the user to enter their selection and also inform them how they can start over or view the menu once they have reached a dead end.

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

### Taskbox vs Menu

A taskbox is the first thing that pops up when the user clicks on the Let‚Äôs chat button giving the user access to pick from all the tasks the bot can perform for the user. It is an easy and convenient way for the user to begin his/her bot journey with the tap of a button on a web bot.

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

WhatsApp does not have a burger menu or a taskbox from where the user can go and make a task selection at the beginning or in the middle of the flow. In this case we use a menu with numbers and the user can make a selection by typing the number that corresponds with his/her desired task.

### Quick Replies vs Freeform User Inputs

On web bots, quick replies are an easy way to ask the user to make a selection or respond to a bot question with the tap of a button. Once the user makes a selection using a quick reply, the other options disappear.

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

On WhatsApp bots, instead of constantly asking for users to type 1, 2 as that might create conflicting intents in the ML pipeline of the bot, ask the user to enter short forms or initials of various options to move the conversation forward.

## What are Smart Skills?

Smart Skills are carefully curated, pre-designed, and highly intelligent conversational journeys. This is the starting point to designing journeys that provide end to end solutions to business problems and can be added to your IVAs within a few clicks. They are editable and can be tailored to suit your business processes and needs.

Using Smart Skills in the IVA not only reduces development time, but also ensures that IVAs are more robust since they contain conversational UI using best design practices, pre-trained domain-specific intents, and demo APIs already integrated.

Haptik’s Smart Skills are focused on **three** major verticals for now -

1. 	[**Ecommerce**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/ecommerce)

2. 	[**Telecom**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/telecom)

3. 	[**Insurance**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/insurance)

WhatsApp HSMs or WhatsApp Notifications - Another powerful way to leverage the WhatsApp Business API. You can send outbound notifications to keep users updated at all times.

**Highly Structured Message (HSM) Templates**

Highly Structured Message (HSM) Templates/Notifications are business initiated, templated messages that can be sent to an existing user.

1. Notifications enable you to:

  - Deliver important, timely messages during your customerâ€™s path to purchase

  - Continue the conversation with customers who respond to your notifications

2. Businesses can only initiate chats if you are sending a transactional notification, and only via approved Message Templates. 

3. Haptik will approve these notification templates on behalf of the business. 

4. Businesses cannot send advertising, marketing or promotional messages.

An HSM is a template message with placeholders for dynamic data. All HSMs need to be approved by WhatsApp before they can be sent to the user. Read more about how to send notifications [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/whatsapp/sending-notifications).

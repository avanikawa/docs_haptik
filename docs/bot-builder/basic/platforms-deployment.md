## How to Deploy the Bot to External Platforms?

After you have created your bot and tested it locally, you can connect the bot to external platforms like Facebook Messenger, Skype, Whatsapp, Webhooks etc. 

Once you have connected the bot to an external platform like Facebook Messenger, users of your bot will be able to use that platform to chat with your bot.

**NOTE:** The businesses and bots created on staging can be transferred to production. But this transfer doesn't include platform settings. This means that platform settings have to be configured explicitly for both the environments as that is not transferred.

You can use the *Platform Deployment* sub-section of the Partner specific area in Business Manager. Here's how you can open this section

1) Go to the Business Manager section of the Conversation Studio tool from the left Navigation Bar.

2) Open the business of the bot you want to connect to external platform and navigate to **Platform Deployment** settings

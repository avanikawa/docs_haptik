title: Smart Assist
---

Intelligent Virtual Assistants are always trained to cater to user queries that fall within a fixed scope. However, at times, customers might ask queries that don’t fall within the scope of the IVA. This tends to prevent the IVA from answering the User’s queries.

A key component in Haptik’s conversational experience is SMART ASSIST. The objective of the component is to respond back to the user smartly when the IVA is not able to completely understand the User’s query. This should open up the pathways for the users to reformulate or redirect their queries, so that appropriate response can be given.

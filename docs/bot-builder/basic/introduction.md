Welcome to **Conversation Studio**, Haptik's tool for making bots! Once you've mastered this tool, you'll be able to build bots with minimal coding. To get you started, we've put together this documentation that will guide you through the process of building a bot.

You can skip straight to the video [**HERE**](https://youtu.be/vEuc4za39hk).

    Tip: A bot is a program that communicates with you, commonly using a chat or voice interface.

**How is *Conversation Studio* used?**
On *Conversation Studio*, you can create a bot i.e. formulate different conversation flows. Instead of creating bots on your own, our Bot Builder gives you a framework and components to build the bot without much effort. 

**How does the Bot building process work?** 
Creating the conversation flow in your bots might seem straightforward, but there are a few things bot builders do to engage users as they interact with bots - 

1. You add the expected user intents (*user says*) and corresponding bot responses (*bot says*)
2. And then, you configure ways a bot is supposed to interpret user's inputs. *Integrations* and *Settings* are components within *Conversation Studio* to configure your bot
3. Once you create the bot, you test it before deploying across any platform. 

We've detailed out the process of creating bots step-by-step, all the way from chatflow design to bot deployment. Read up the various articles from the left-hand navigation to know more. 

    Tool Tips: For those of you who want to jump right in, we've built tooltips directly into Conversation Studio. 
    By hovering over the tooltips, which are indicated by the small "i" or "?" in circles, you'll be able 
    to view brief descriptions of how to use most of the major components in Conversation Studio.

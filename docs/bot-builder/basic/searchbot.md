Now, the bot builder can search for

1. User Says
2. Bot Says
3. Nodes
4. Sub story
5. Story

And the following filters should work while searching - 

1. Active/Inactive 

   *This filter can help search from active stories or inactive nodes independently.* 
       
2. Type of node

   *You can narrow down your search from Graph (regular) nodes to General nodes and so on.*
    
3. Language
   
   *To check copies in Hindi/English mode specifically* 
       
4. Case-sensitive 
       
   *You use this filter to search some strict case phrases. This search functionality is really useful in complex bots with multiple nodes and user says. Especially, while debugging to go back and modify something on the bot.*
   
5. Regex

   *You can use multiple expressions to search for only numbers or email-ids.* 

    Ex: Searching `o(a|d)+` will match the results with pattern oa or od.

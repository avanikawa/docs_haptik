## WhatsApp as a Platform

[WhatsApp](https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000637/Introducing-the-WhatsApp-Business-App) helps over 1.5 billion users keep in touch with their friends and close ones. If the latest numbers are to be believed WhatsApp users send across 65 Billion Messages Per Day. WhatsApp also offers its platform as a model for businesses to engage and interact with customers. This allows various businesses to automate their customer support and build bots that can resolve their customer queries instantly on one of the largest messaging platforms across the world.

## What is the potential the WhatsApp platform comes with?

“If you get a WhatsApp message, you’re probably going to open it. That’s the interesting thing.” — Harper Reed.

The reach is massive and notifications are a powerful medium to engage with users. Transactional customer support cases are a great example to initiate on WA and interact with your consumer on one of the most widely used platforms.

There are 2 ways to leverage WA - 

- **Bot**: An AI-powered WhatsApp Bot where users can simply send their concerns, queries or engage with a company/brand using WhatsApp and the query will be addressed within seconds. No more waiting on IVR lines, or struggling to find a customer service agent to resolve queries.

- **Notifications**: These are WhatsApp messages that companies can send to customers for different use cases. These are similar to service SMS messages that consumers receive from various brands for updates.

## Some platform limitations to note

1. No UI elements - This platform limitation actually gets the designers creative juices flowing as in the absence of elements the bot has to be designed in a way that it flows seamlessly

2. Verified WhatsApp accounts are sole discretion of WhatsApp. As per WhatsApp’s policy, only notable brands will be verified by WhatsApp. 

3. Limitations on notifications - can't use media. You can only send raw text and cannot send images or any other media form as a notification on WhatsApp.

4. WhatsApp will only receive images from users and no other form of media.

5. WhatsApp decides the quality of the content (we have to send all HSMs for WhatsApp approval) and assigns a tier for message limit. This cannot be controlled by us.

6. A robust opt-in and good quality content is necessary to maintain the status of the registered WhatsApp phone number. Lack of attention here can result in the number getting flagged for content or warned.

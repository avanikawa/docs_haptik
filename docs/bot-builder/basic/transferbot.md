## When and Why to use the Transfer option?

Once the bot is ready and needs to be taken live on production, that is when we use the transfer option. 
On clicking the Transfer button, the bot and business manager are made available on the production environment as well.
→ Only the bot and business manager are needed to be transferred, a new partner on production should be created before the transfer process.
→ The Business Manager should be transferred to production before the bot.

Transferring your Business from staging to production:
The Business Manager is responsible for the configuration of multiple key characteristics of the bot such as the appearance of the bot, bot break messages, deployment settings and so on. Hence, the business needs to be transferred to the production environment.
→ The business manager should be transferred again upon making any changes post the bot is live.

Where is the Transfer option on the Business Manager?

There are four options for Transfer Business:

→ Transfer Business means it will transfer all the information configured on the General Settings Page
→ Transfer All Tasks means it transfers all the taskbox items which are configured in Partner Settings.
→ Transfer All Prompt Triggers means it transfers only the Bot Prompt Triggers which are configured
→ Transfer All means it transfers all the information present in the Business Manager.

Transferring your bot from staging to production:
The transfer button is on the top-right corner of the bot page.

Whenever the Transfer button is clicked, all the Story(s), Sub-Story(s), entities, connections and details of the bots are transferred to the production environment.
→ The bot should be transferred again if there are modifications carried made after the bot is live.

## Logging in

The Bot builder gets an email with credentials and link to the *Bot builder* tool. 

Using the credentials, a bot builder logs in and clicks on **Bot Builder**.

You can read on further about the steps in creating a bot by [starting from here](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/making-first-bot). 

## Conversation Design before Bot creation

Our objective is not just to make bots, but also to create a robust experience for the end user. So, before you go ahead and start building the bot, you should be clear on the following aspects:

* User Intents: Possible queries an user needs answers to or actions an user wants to complete
* Defined Happy paths: User flows covering all conversation steps and bot responses 
* Edge cases: Broken experiences needs to covered like we use null states and error messages in websites or mobile apps.

To start with, explore the [Introduction to Conversation Design](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/conversation-design-introduction) section.

## Key Steps

Once you are clear on the bot solution, follow the steps as mentioned below -

1. Create a rough requirement diagram of the possible user conversations
2. Demo the bot by writing scripts while talking to people as per your flow diagram in step 1
3. Now, create a bot in our staging environment. This is our UAT stage 
4. [Testing/Debugging the bot](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/testing-bot) to avoid any unpredictabilities
5. Deploy the bot and start getting insights from our [analytics tool](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics).

Conversation Studio allows you to build **Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA)s** which is equipped with various skills, handles FAQs and responds to casual conversations. **Skill Sets**, **FAQs** and **Small Talk** sections handle all these requirements respectively.

## Skill Sets

A **Skill Set** is a collection of skills that enable your IVA to handle queries that need a complex conversational journey. These skills help the user to resolve their queries. A Skill Set aligns with the overall goals of the IVA.  

On Conversation Studio, a varied array of these skills are already present and are known as **Smart Skills**. You can read more about them [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/smartskills).

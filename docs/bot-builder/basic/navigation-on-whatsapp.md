## Chat Initiation

But before you start building a WhatsApp IVA, it’s important to first answer the crucial question – **How do you start acquiring customers on WhatsApp?**

A key point to note is that WhatsApp requires a brand to get an opt-in from a user before it can start engaging with him/her i.e. the user needs to consent to start a conversation with your business.

Here’s a quick guide to some of the techniques you can use to begin your brand’s conversations with customers on the world’s largest messaging channel.

## Introduction & Authentication on WhatsApp

As per WhatsApp's business policy - either a chat is user-initiated OR the brand sends push notifications to engage with a user. After acquiring your customer base and learning who you want to target you should continue with identifying the user.

When a user initiates a chat on WhatsApp, the mobile number of the user and the WhatsApp name are shared via the WhatsApp Business API. This information can be subsequently used to personalize the user’s interaction with your brand on WhatsApp.

- **Name**: Greet the user by their name. It helps to establish trust with the end-user.
- **Number**: The user’s phone number can be leveraged in multiple ways. If the user is looking to seek any specific information related to their account, the WhatsApp number becomes the unique identifier. Using the WhatsApp phone number, we can first authenticate the user and then fetch information based on their request.

Give users a secure onboarding by authenticating their phone number and asking them if they want to move ahead with that specific phone number. If they choose to authenticate another phone number, go ahead and use OTP verification to allow them to log in safely and securely.

This not only gives the user flexibility to switch numbers and authenticate themselves to carry out a task on the IVA but also allows for re-engagement using past information.

**Step 3**: Fill the bot details according to the instructions given here:

- **Bot Name (in chatflow)**: Give your bot a name. This is visible on the chat window for the end users. 

      Ex: When the user asks "Who are you?". The bot replies with "I'm <Bot Name>". 

- **Partner**: A partner is the Conversation Studio's largest unit, and can be deployed in multiple locations (i.e. a website, Android and iOS Apps, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Google Business Manager, etc.). Usually, its your organisation's name or project's name.

- **Select Languages**: Select the languages you want to create the bot in. The default is **English**.

**Step 4**: Click on **Create Bot** to successfully create your bot. The below pop up would come showing the success message

**Step 5**: Clicking on **View Bot** would take you to the bot page, where you'll be prompted to input the stories, sub-stories and nodes that will make up your conversation flow.

> A **Business** is created of the same name as the bot. Business takes care of all configurations of the bot ranging from color, chat icon, language, channel, etc.

### Advanced Settings

There are other advanced settings of the bot available on the same page.

All these fields help shape up the personality of the bot and also answers these questions in the conversations, if asked by users.

Before you get started on building your bot, read about the [**bot hierarchy**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/bot-hierarchy) to get a fair understanding of how it all comes together.

title: Analyse Closing Categories
---

At the end every conversation, agents have to mark a closing category along with reason. This is mandatory if the closing categories have been set up initially.

While analysing the chats, Closing Categories help you provide an insight of how many queries you are receiving for a particular category.

Once you open the category, you will get further classification of number of chats having a particular reason.

The closing category heatmap can help you analyse the high incoming number of queries you are receiving on the bot and prioritizing which user flow you can automate on the bot.

## Logging in

The chat agent gets an email with credentials to the **Smart Agent Chat** tool. 

Using the credentials, a chat agent logs in and clicks on **Smart Agent Chat**. Now, the chat agent can essentially click on the **My Chats** tab i.e. the first option depicted in the left-hand menu.

## How to use My Chats?

SCREENSHOT

In this tab the chat agent can start taking chats assigned to him/her personally. The screen is divided into multiple sections. We will call it LHS, Centre and RHS for ease of understanding.

### Starting with the Left Hand Side of the screen - 

LHS SCREENSHOT

A chat agent can:
  * View agent's display name
  * View Agent Status - Online or Offline
  * View his live chats stats (Completed, Waiting for user, My Queue, Team Queue)
  * View his active chats

Name and Status SCREENSHOT

#### Agent Bar

The agent will be able to view his name and also his current status. 

POP SCREENSHOT

Agent can also choose the change the status by clicking on **"Go Online"** or **"Go Offline"**. Before chnaging the status, a pop up would come to confirm the change.

#### Live Chat Stats

This section will give all numbers important for the agent.

Live chats SCREENSHOT

- **Completed**: Number of chats completed today, as per the agents timezone.
- **Waiting for user**: Number of chats currently in waiting state of this agent.
- **Agent queue**: Chats that have been manually assigned to the agent, or **Waiting for user** chats that has got a user reply
- **Team Queue**: Chats that are currently waiting to be taken up by the team. 

> If an agent is part of multiple teams, we show the combined number for team queue.

#### Your Active Chats

This section will show all chats that are currently assigned to the agent.

Your active chats SCREENSHOT (Will all types of tags)

We show the following details -

- **User name**: This is the name of the user. If the user has provided his name, that would show up or it will be **Guest User**.
- **Last message time**: This will either be the first user message time (among consecutive user messages), or the latest agent reply time, whichever is earlier.
- **Waiting longest**: This is a tag used for chats which have not had a reply for over 5 mins, or the longest waiting chat.
- **New Chat**: This is a tag whenever a new chat comes in.
- **Number tab**: This is a tag showing number of messages that the agent has not yet read or responded to.

**Max number of chats** displayed here would be based on agents concurrent count. 

On click, the chat gets selected in the center page and the tags go away only if the agent replies.Agent can click on chats,  but the tag stays the same until the agent sends a message on the chat.

> An agent can receive new conversations only in the Online state.

### Coming to the centre of the screen -

CENTRE SCREENSHOT

A chat agent can:
  * Exchange messages with the user
  * Mark chat as **Complete** and **Waiting for user**
  * Send [smart actions](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/smart-actions)
  * Assign chat to a person or a team
  * Adding [disposition tags](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/claiming-and-closing#chat-disposition)
  
> When an agent is offline, he would not get the option of **Waiting for user** but only **Reassigning Chat** and **Closing Category** as compared to online state, where agents get to see all controls mentioned above.

### And the last is the Right Hand Side of the screen -

RHS SCREENSHOT

A chat agent can:
  * View User Details
  * Use [custom tools
  * View Previous Conversations
  
User Details SCREENSHOT

Understanding the basic details of the user like Name, Phone Number, Email, etc, help agents understand the background of the user and help users better. This section gives us all those details about the user.

Custom Tool SCREENSHOT

Custom tools like ticketing system, CRM, search fields, etc. can be used by agents in this section to solve users queries further, while they continue to have conversations with users.

Previous Conversation SCREENSHOT

NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT Previous Conversations

Depending on the permissions and features assigned to a Chat agent user, more actions could become accessible. 
  
> We also have a system to enforce Data level permissioning i.e. an agent user is allowed to view/edit data for which business can be controlled using this.

title: Agent Daily Statistics Mailer
---

Agents receive their daily statistics over email at the end of the day. This mail talks about all important metrics pertaining to the conversations held throughout the day.

This is the sample mailer which goes -

      Hi <Agent-name>,

      Please check your statistics for the day <Date> below - 

      Chats received: <Total number of conversations that the agent participated in, similar to the one shown on Team Analytics>
      Online hours: <Total number of hours that an agent was online using Smart Agent Chat>
      Total positive <feedback received: This is the total number of high-value (4 or 5) ratings received by the agent>
      Average Resolution Time: <The average time taken by the agent to resolve or re-assign the conversation>, Note: Resolution time is simply calculated from the user’s first message sent timestamp till the last agent/user message timestamp in a chat
      Average Response Time: <Average time taken by the agent to reply to a user query>, Note: Resolution time is simply calculated from the user’s first message>

      Have a good day ahead and stay safe. 

      All the best for tomorrow. 

      Thank you,

      Team Haptik.

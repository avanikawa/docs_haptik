title: Sounds and Notifications
---

Notifications and sounds are sent to agents to increase their productivity. These help to get their attention back. 

Following are the scenarios where we send these notifications and sounds -

## New chat

1. When the agent is on the MyChats screen, a newly assigned chat will be indicated by a sound.
2. When the agent is not on the MyChats screen or using some other application, a newly assigned chat will be indicated by a notification popup accompanied with a sound. 

> The number of active chats will be indicated on the MyChats screen icon.

## New message

1. When the agent is on the MyChats screen and receives a new message from any user, it will be indicated with just the number bubble and no sound.
2. When the agent is not on MyChats screen and receives a message from any user, it will be indicated with a sound and a notification.

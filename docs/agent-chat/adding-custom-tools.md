### Important Design Note

- The RHS section, where the tool loads is restricted to exactly 26% of the page ~ 360px in width in most cases.
- Please make sure that the tool is responsive to all required screen resolutions

### Important Tech Note

- An external tool appears for a business, if a user wishes to use the same tool across multiple businesses, they can do so by adding a the same entry for the other businesses.

- Please make sure your `X-Frame-Options` is set to allow our host, so that your tool can open within our iframe.

```json
Header set X-Frame-Options "allow-from https://staging.hellohaptik.com"
```

### Sample Integrations

You can refer to [this sample](https://toolassets.haptikapi.com/integrations/sample/index.v2.1.html) integration tool as a reference point.


### Expansion of the RHS Custom tool

We have an expand click that allows you the expand the RHS section so that agents can easily perform actions on an external tool. Once you switch the chat tab ie move to another chat, the RHS section moves from expand state to a default state (covering 26% width of your screen).

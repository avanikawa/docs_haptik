In real-time, agents receive the chats on **MyChats** Page of the Smart Agent Chat. Once they receive the chats they can start responding back to the users. Along with responding back to the user, agents can check the different chats they are handling, agents can raise a tickets in your CRM system and so on.

## Notifications and Sounds

Notifications and sounds are sent to agents to increase their productivity. These help to get their attention back. 

Following are the scenarios where we send these notifications and sounds -

### New chat

1. When the agent is on the MyChats screen, a newly assigned chat will be indicated by a sound.
2. When the agent is not on the MyChats screen or using some other application, a newly assigned chat will be indicated by a notification popup accompanied with a sound. 

> The number of active chats will be indicated on the MyChats screen icon.

Chat Solutions at Haptik can be powered entirely by Artificial Intelligence (AI) or by a combination of AI and Chat Agents. We have built a *Smart Agent Chat* tool for it. This tool is created for operationally managing user chats.

You can go through the below introductory video of **Smart Agent Chat** to take a birds eye-view of the tool.

## Using *Smart Agent Chat*

Agents and Team Leads are the users of this tool. They can take daily chats on their business as agents and analyse or monitor chats as team leads.

## Main components

There are three sections in this tool: 

1. My Chats - This section is used by agents.
2. Businesses  - This section is used by business owners or team leads.
3. Teams - This section is used by team leads.

You will read about the above concepts in subsequent sections.

**My Chats** is a section, where you converse with users i.e. agents receive and send messages. You can read more about it [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/for-chat-agents).

    Tip: In case a bot is unable to respond to a query, which is outside the chat flow, 
    the chat is handed over to a chat agent. 

Chat flows are designed to guide the user through a specific problem and to ensure the best experience for all users. And our *Smart Agent Chat* tool helps connect users to agents for answering their queries. 

    Tip: "Agents" are people who chat with users on the tool.

**Businesses** and **Teams** are sections to analyse your business/team data and configure respective settings for incoming chats. You can read more about it [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/agent-chat/for-team-leads).

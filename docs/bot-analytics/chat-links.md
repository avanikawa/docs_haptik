title: Chat Link
---

Chat links are extremely useful when you want to share a particular user conversation. Whether the conversation is between the user and the bot or between user and a live agent, chat links can be shared across with anyone.

## **What all information chat links contain?**

Chat links have - 
* Conversation between the user and the bot/agent.
* User details such as their name, email and the information which you have collected in the bot.
* The timestamps at which the messages were exchanged between user and the bot/agent.

Along with information, for ease of action, there are two buttons, namely, **Previous Conversation** and **Next Conversation** to toggle between multiple conversations of the user.

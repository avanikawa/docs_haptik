## What are User Ratings?
The User Ratings page of the Intelligent Analytics tool provides information about the ratings given by a user for a bot. 

Based on the configuration made by the bot developers, a bot might ask for feedback from user at the end of a chat. The feedback it captures involves a star rating out of 5 and a free form text review or comment. 

> **Tip**: The configuration to take user feedback can be made from the `General Settings` tab of the `Business Manager` section in the bot builder tool.

You can filter the ratings based on Channels or Bots and for any date range from the top navigation bar.

## ***Overall Channel Rating***
At the top of the User Ratings page you have the Overall Channel Rating. The Overall Channel Rating gives you a high level view of how your bot was rated overall.

In the left corner of this section you can see the average star rating provided by all users and also how many total feedbacks and comments were given.

Next to it you can see the total number of people that have given a particular number of stars. For example you can see how many users gave 5 stars, how many gave 4 stars and so on. You can find both the percentage and absolute number of users for any feedback.

If the user provided any comments in feedback those can be viewed by clicking on the link shown with a chat icon. Even these comments are categorized based on the number of stars a user provided before giving the comment. This helps give some context about the comment.

### Reviews
Once you click on the reviews link, it opens a new page with list of all comments provided by users for a given star rating.

You can see list of comments provided, the task for which the user has given the feedback and also a link to view the complete chat.

## ***Rating Trends***
Below the Overall Chat Ratings you have the Rating trends where you can see how the user ratings varied over time.

On X axis you have the time and on Y axis you have the total number of users that have given the rating. There are two graphs available here.

### Rating Ratio
The first graph present in the Rating Trends section is called Rating Ratio. Here an area graph is used to show the split of users giving different levels of ratings over a period of time.

You can get more detailed information about the user ratings at any given time by hovering on the graph.

At the bottom of the graph you can see a legend explaining that the red line indicates the average rating given by the user.

Similar to the previous graph you can view the specific average rating at any point of time by hovering on the graph.

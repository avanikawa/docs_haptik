Our tool helps you build an experience that is

1. Adaptable
2. Responsive
3. Actionable

## Adaptability

While your bot is built for certain actions, you can add to the existing set of user intents. We give you actionable insights from [Story analysis](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics/story-analysis) and incoming/outgoing traffic details on the [Node Traffic here](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics/node-traffic).

## Responsiveness

The [Message analysis](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics/using-message-analysis) section can be used to figure the conversations where the bot didn't work and how could we optimise our bot further. You can use a series of filters and also export the messages in a csv for analysis.

## Actionable insights

We provide the User reviews/ratings to evaluate your bot performance. The primary goal of this tool is to help you update or modify the bot with time. 

On a daily basis, you can analyse the user messages or bot responses on the bot. Read on further to understand each component and datapoint that could matter to you.

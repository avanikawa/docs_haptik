## Introduction

For a business which has deployed an IVA solution, it is imperative to know if the IVA is being able to resolve usersâ€™ queries i.e. when users are asking questions, is the IVA able to respond with appropriate responses and not requires a human intervention.

**Query Completion** helps us track how users navigate across different nodes and end up getting their query answered. In other words, it indicates the effectiveness of an IVA. This feature will play an important role to enhance our user journeys and IVA content. Various metrics like completion rate, drop-off rate, drop-off nodes, and query volume help us achieve the same . 

> Nodes are interlinked building blocks of an IVA. Each node takes care of one intent coming from the user and responds appropriately.

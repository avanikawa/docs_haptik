Qualitative feedback is as important as quantitative feedback.

User Review section shows you the feedback that users give at the end of their conversations with the IVA. Reviews have the power to make or break a companyâ€™s credibility.

Reading negative feedback, you can use it to make changes to either the product, services or to the IVA design.

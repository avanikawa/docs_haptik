As the name suggests **Word Analysis** helps you know the words which the IVA was not able to understand in the user's messages, resulting in a bot break.

## Bot Break Topics

Word analysis helps to classify messages into bot break topics. There are two options to **filter** Bot Break topics, **Clustered** and **Unclustered**.

Bot Break Topics also gives us visibility of **Messages**, **Users** and **Confidence level** of the model for each filter so that we can take an informed decision.

#### Clustered Bot Break Topics

This filter clubs all the similar or same words that caused the IVA to break the maximum.

#### Unclustered Bot Break Topics

Unclustered Bot Break Topics creates a topic on the basis of same messages received by the IVA that caused the bot break.

There is a **others** topic at the end of the the table. This topic contains all the random messages which were received by the IVA that caused the bot break. These messages were received by the IVA not more than once.

## Word Cloud

This section also helps to **identify and train** the IVA on words and queries which are coming in high in volume, but which the IVA is not able to understand currently.

The larger the volume, bigger is the word shown on the dashboard. You can click on the words and you will be redirected to the **Message Analysis** page wherein you can read the messages exchanged between the IVA and the user.

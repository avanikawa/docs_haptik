## Word Cloud

This section also helps to **identify and train** the IVA on words and queries which are coming in high in volume, but which the IVA is not able to understand currently.

The larger the volume, bigger is the word shown on the dashboard. You can click on the words and you will be redirected to the **Message Analysis** page wherein you can read the messages exchanged between the IVA and the user.

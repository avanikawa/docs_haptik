- **Is 8 minutes inactivity window for calculating one conversation configurable?**

No, 8 minutes inactivity window is not configurable. After 8 minutes of inactivity, the conversation is marked completed. However, the IVA remembers the context for 2 hours. So if the user comes back within 2 hours, the IVA will be able to help him with the saved context of the user's previous conversation.

- **If the conversation is assigned to an agent, do we still close the conversation if there are no interactions for 8 minutes?**

We do not close conversations which have been assigned to an agent, we only close conversations which are not assigned or are in queued states.

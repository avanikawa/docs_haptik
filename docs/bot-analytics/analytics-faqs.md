- **Is this 8 minutes inactivity window configurable?**

At the moment, it is not configurable.

- **If the conversation is assigned to an agent, do we still close the conversation if there are no interactions for 8 minutes.**

We do not close conversations which have been assigned to an agent, we only close conversations which are not assigned or are in queued states. 

- **Will the data based on the old definition of conversations be available?**

Yes. A user can view the past data based on the old definition for upto 3 months after the new definition release i.e. 31st August, 2020.

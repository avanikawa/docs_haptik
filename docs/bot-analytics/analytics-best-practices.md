 ### Best practices to follow
 
1. Analysing the conversations using Message Analysis.


2. Analysing feedback collected from the user.


3. Analyse the bot break message using Message Analysis and note down the bot break categories.
  - These messages can help you add new intents on the bot or add them to the existing intents on Conversation Studio.
  - You can copy these intents from the chat links or download the data from Message Analysis.


4. Make improvement to the existing bot by looking at the Funnel drop off.
  * You can modify the existing flow by changing the outro flow, changing the existing bot responses, changing the user journey.


5. Building a flow if the data suggests that users are not happy with an FAQ approach.


6. Highlight all API errors immediately.


7. Set usage and automation percentage triggers to get notified in case of drop in usage or bot performance.


8. Review of the chats where users showed dissatisfaction and create action items to improve user experience.


9. Arrange for UX retro with Conversation Design team if the bot has too many breaking flows or user journeys.

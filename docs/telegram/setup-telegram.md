title: Create a bot on Telegram

Setting up a Telegram bot is a simple 2 step process followed by connecting it to a Haptik bot that you create.

## Step 1: Start creating a new bot on Telegram
 
To get started with the Telegram bot, you will first need to create a new bot on Telegram.
 
Open your Telegram account and search for **BotFather** in the search bar. **BotFather** will ask you some questions about the new bot want to create.

Click on **Start**.
 
The **BotFather** responds with the list commands that can be used to create a new bot.
 
## Step 2: Create the bot by providing bot details
 
### 1. Provide bot name
 
Once you start typing **/new** Telegram will auto-suggest the option to create a new bot, tap on the **/newbot** command.

### 2. Provide username for the bot

Once the bot name is accepted, Telegram will then ask you to enter a username.
 
The username should end with **__bot** and should be unique. If the username is already taken, it will ask you to provide the username again.
 
Once the username is accepted, you will receive a **Congratulations** message along with an **API token** for the bot.
 
> Copy this API token in a safe place, you will have to provide the key in the Platform Deployment section of Haptik Platform.

Now the bot has been created on Telegram.

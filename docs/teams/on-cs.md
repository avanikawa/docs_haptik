title: Using Conversation Studio
---

Once the bot is created on Teams, you can now build the user journeys on the Conversation Studio tool of Haptik Platform.
 
## 1. Create a new bot on Conversation Studio
 
1. Go to [**Conversation Studio**](https://staging.hellohaptik.com/mogambo/#/bots)
2. Click on **New Bot**
3. Provide a **name**, select the **partner** from the dropdown, and provide some additional details (these are optional)
4. Click on **Create Bot**

## 2. Create SkillSet and Skills
 
A Skill Set is a collection of skills that enable your IVA to handle queries that need a complex conversational journey. These skills help the user to resolve their queries. A Skill Set aligns with the overall goals of the IVA.
 
Click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/create-your-first-bot) to know more about SkillSet and Skills.
 
 
## 3. Create Nodes
 
Nodes are the interlinked building blocks of a bot. Each node acts like a gatekeeper which **detects user inputs**, sends out appropriate **responses**, and **directs users** to the next node. 
 
Nodes are composed of several important sub-components, which house important pieces of information - User Says, Bot Says, Entities, and APIs.
 
To know more about Nodes, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/creating-nodes).
 
## 4. Add User Says
 
User says are the inputs from the user that the agent needs to interpret the userâ€™s goal. It is important to add and train the bot with a variety of different sample user says for each node to identify the correct intents and extract entities from the user utterance.
 
Whenever a user sends a message, we try to understand what the user is trying to say using various Machine Learning algorithms and find the corresponding node. One of the key modules which is used for node identification is **Intent Detection module**.

## 5. Add Bot Says
 
Bot Says is where a Node stores the replies that are sent in response to the user's message.

## 6. Add Entities
 
An entity represents values that are collected from the user in a conversation. Depending on the context of the conversation, the required response can either be a single value or a group of specific values.
 
To know more about entities, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/entities).
 
## 7. Create Connections
 
Connections represent the path a conversation takes from node to node. Depending on the response a user inputs to the bot, they traverse down a different connection to the appropriate next node. Bot builders must modify every connection they create to indicate which user inputs correspond to which nodes.
 
To know more about connections, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/connections).
 
## 8. Quality Assessment
 
Follow our [**Quality Assessment**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/testing-introduction) section to test the bot.
 
Once the bot is functionally tested, you can now provide the credentials on the **Platform Deployments** section of **Business Manager** section on the Conversation Studio tool.
 
## 9. Provide the Platform Deployment settings
 
Once the bot is created on the Conversation Studio tool, you can provide the keys as mentioned [**here**](http://docs.haptik.ai/teams/setup-teams).
 
After the credentials are provided, you can now test the bot on the Teams bot.

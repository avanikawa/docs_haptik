Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work. Apps are how you extend Teams to fit your needs. You can create a bot for Teams or integrate an existing app.

Conversations often result in the need to do something (generate an order, review my code, check ticket status, and so on). A bot can kick off these kinds of workflows right inside Teams. A bot acts as an intermediary between a Teams user and a web service. Users can chat with a bot to quickly get information, initiate workflows, or anything else your web service can do.

Haptik Platform can help you elevate the user experience by adding NLP capabilities using conversational flows on your Teams bot. Using the Conversation Studio tool of Haptik Platform, you can build user journeys to resolve user queries faster. You can create conversational user journeys, connect the user to an agent if any human intervention is required, and so on.

To get started with a Teams bot, you can simply start to create a new bot on Teams. Click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/teams/setup-teams) to set up a Teams bot powered by the Haptik Platform.

Haptik Platform has multiple tools like Bot Builder, Agent Chat and Chat Analytics. All of these tools have numerous features which help us create complex and sophisticated Conversational AI solutions like IVA.

But what if you get stuck somewhere or you want to know about a particular feature in more depth. To handle these, we have a **Support Bot** in place to help you.

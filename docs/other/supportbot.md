Haptik Platform has multiple tools like Conversation Studio, Smart Agent Chat, and Intelligent Analytics. All of these tools have numerous features that help us create complex and sophisticated Conversational AI solutions like IVA.

But what if you get stuck somewhere or you want to know about a particular feature in more depth. To handle these, we have a **Support Bot** in place to help you. 

## Where and how can you access the Support Bot from?

You can access the Support bot from all tool pages, i.e. from Home Page, Conversation Studio, Smart Agent Chat, and Intelligent Analytics. The bot is also accessible from both, staging and production environments.
You can click on the icon highlighted in the below diagram to open the Support Bot. The bot will open up as shown below with a cross button on the top right corner to close the bot.

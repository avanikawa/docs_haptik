## Uptime

We guarantee that 99.9% of the time the Covered Service will successfully receive and respond to API requests on the production environment.

The following definitions apply to the SLA:

- **"Covered Service"** means Haptik's end user chat experience. Conversation Studio, Analytics and other development tools are not covered under this SLA.
- **"Downtime"** means more than a 5% Error Rate. Downtime is measured based on server side Error Rate.
- **"Downtime Period"** means a period of one or more consecutive minutes of Downtime. Partial minutes or Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than one minute will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.
- **"Error Rate"** means the number of Valid Requests that result in a response with HTTP Status 500 and Code "Internal Error" divided by the total number of Valid Requests during that period.
- **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"** means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month.
- **"Valid Requests"** are requests that conform to the Documentation, and that would normally result in a non-error response.

## SLA Exclusions

The SLA does not apply to

1. Factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
2. The result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;
3. Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;
4. Features designated Alpha or Beta (unless stated otherwise in the associated Documentation);
5. The result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service;
6. The event of a scheduled maintenance window (intimation of which, will be provided in advance).

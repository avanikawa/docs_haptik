## Analytics on Google Business Messages

Google Business Messages tracks key performance metrics to make sure agent performs well.

Apart from Inteligent Analytics dashboard metrics, Google also shares the following metrics - 
 
Google Business Messages have 2 target metrics - 
 * **CSAT**: The **Customer Satisfaction** percentage.
 * **MRR**: The **Merchant Response Rate** i.e. the frequency at which the agent(bot) responds back to the user.

## Improving Metrics of agent

If the agent performance is low, make sure your agent does the following - 

### Process and respond to messages without technical issue

* Check for all the webhooks and confirm if the messages are being sent to the user.
* Check for the fallback strategy if some information is missing.

### Reply intelligently and compassionately

* Reply to every message. Automated replies can help you address common questions.
* Be aware of users' conversation entry points and respond accordingly. For example, users coming from Google Maps are more likely interested in location-specific information like opening hours and stock checks.
* For location-based messages, route questions to the individuals best suited to respond to them.
* If a live agent isn't available, use automation to response to the user. Let them know your agent's chat hours and how else they might reach someone (for example, a support phone number).

### Provide guidance

Make use of guidance messages, conversation startes to make the conversational journey easier for the user.

### Handle data carefully

* Whenever possible, gather location and other data from messages you receive rather than asking for it.
* Don't request sensitive information (log in credentials, banking/credit details, personal identification numbers).
* Only ask for data when it's required. Data overreach creates a bad user experience.
* When you need data, be clear about why and how you'll use it.

### Behave asynchronously

* Don't mark conversations as inactive. Communications over Business Messages is ansynchronous, so users may not respond immediately.
* Don't follow up on unresponsive users. Users aren't disconnected after navigating away from the conversation.

A widget will open to begin the team setup.

The steps to setup the team are as follows - 

1. Provide the **Queue name** and **Team name**.
2. Select the **members** you want to add to the team.
3. Provide a **Priority**. If you have multiple queues, priority will help the routing configuration to prioritize a queue.
4. Adjust the chat workload by providing the Work Item Size and Agent Capacity -

For example, 1 chat can be considered as 1 work item and agent capacity is set at 10 i.e. 1 agent can handle 10 chats at a time.

5. Provide the secured (https) webpage where you will deploying the IVA.

> Note: This link won't be used in our integration anywhere since Haptik SDK will be directly integrated with your platform.

6. Select the type as **Service**.
7. Keep the offline support toggle **off** here. You will need to configure the offline message  from Haptik platform as mentioned in the documentation later.
8. You will get a code snippet for integration on your platform - skip this step since Haptik's integration on your platform will handle live agent integration automatically.

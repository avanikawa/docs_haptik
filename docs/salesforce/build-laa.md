title: Implement Live Agent Automation
---

After completing the **Setup** on Salesforce account and connection to Haptik Platform, you can collect some user information and transfer the user's chat to an agent on Salesforce account.

## Step 1: Create a New Bot

We will start by creating a new bot on the platform. 

1. Go to [**Conversation Studio**](https://staging.hellohaptik.com/mogambo/#/bots)
2. Click on **New Bot**
3. Provide a **name**, select the **partner** from dropdown and provide some additional details (these are optional)
4. Click on **Create Bot**

## Step 2: Create a Story and Sub Story

After creating a new bot, create a new Story within the bot. 
To know more about Story, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/creating-story).

Within the story, create a new sub story. Every Sub Story handles one use-case. 
To know more about Sub Story, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/creating-story).

## Step 3: Create Nodes

Nodes are the interlinked building blocks of a bot. Each node acts like a gatekeeper which **detects user inputs**, sends out appropriate **responses**, and **directs users** to the next node. 

Nodes are composed of several important sub-components, which house important pieces of information - User Says, Bot Says, Entities, and APIs.

To know more about Nodes, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/creating-nodes).

## Step 4: Add User Says

User says are the inputs from the user that the agent needs to interpret the userâ€™s goal. It is important to add and train the bot with a variety of different sample user says for each node, so that the bot can identify the correct intents and extract entities from the user utterance.

Whenever a user sends a message, we try to understand what the user is trying to say using various Machine Learning algorithms and find the corresponding node. One of the key modules which is used for node identification is **Intent Detection module**.

To know more about adding user says, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/user-says-guidelines).

## Step 5: Add Bot Says

Bot Says is where a Node stores the replies that are sent in response to the user's message. 

To know more about Bot Says, click [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/bot-says)

### Using Chat Elements (HSLs)

Chat Elements are used to send different types to responses to the user.

Read more about chat elements, [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/chat-elements).

## Step 6: Add Entities

An entity represents values which is collected from the user in a conversation. Depending on the context of the conversation, the required response can either be a single value or group of specific values.

You can read more about entities [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/entities).

## Step 7: Create Connections

Connections represent the path a conversation takes from node to node. Depending on the response a user inputs to the bot, they traverse down a different connection to the appropriate next node. Bot builders must modify every connection they create to indicate which user inputs correspond to which nodes.

## Step 8: Transfer the user to an agent

At all points of agent transfer within the bot flow, the following code should be sent as the **final_response** within the code node to transfer chat to Salesforce agent

```
    final_response = {
        'status': "Chat now", 
        'user_details': user_details,
        'callback_ops': {
            'tract_atc': {
                'receiver': 'message_delivery_salesforce'
            }
        }
    }
```

Refer to the sample code to transfer the user to an agent on Salesforce.

```
def transferChatToAgent(user_name):

     url = "https://staging.hellohaptik.com" + "/integration/external/v1.0/send_chat_to_agent/"
     payload = {"team_name":"team_name_on_salesforce","user_name": user_name, "business_id": xxxx} 
     header = {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         'Authorization': f"<token>",
         'client-id': 'xxxxxx'        # this is the consumer key
     }
     try:
         response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=header, json=payload)
         response.raise_for_status()
         print(f"[transferChatToAgent] API schematics headers: {header} payload:{payload} response {response.json()}")
         return True
     except Exception as e:
         print(f'[transferChatToAgent] API failed due to {e} request {header} response {response.json()}')
         return False
```

## Step 9: Configure the External Chat tool on Business Manager

Open the [**Business Manager**](https://staging.hellohaptik.com/mogambo/#/businesses) to configure Salesforce as the Chat tool

## Step 10: Add Taskbox (optional)

You can add a Taskbox which provides a default option for the users select from. The process to add a taskbox is mentioned [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/business#taskbox).

## Step 11: Test the connection

After the setup and configuration, you can test the connection between bot and the agent.

## Step 12: Quality Assessment

Follow our [**Quality Assessment**](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/testing-introduction) section to test the bot.

title: What is a Webhook
---

Webhooks provide functionality where a provider application can notify a client-side application when a new event has occurred on the provider's server.

Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP/S callbacks", that allows two applications to communicate automatically.

A key difference between an API endpoint and a webhook:

In APIs, the client-side application calls the server-side application to retrieve some sort of information. Whereas, in the case of webhooks it is the server-side that calls the client-side application when a particular server-side event occurs.
